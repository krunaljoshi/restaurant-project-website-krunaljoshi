        <b>4.</b> Explain what the DOM is in your own words and how it relates to an HTML page and why it might differ.        
      </section>
      <section class="answer">
        <b>Ans:</b> DOM is basically the code of the web page accessed via web browser using the DevTools or inspect tool. 
          It is different from our html page because, there are times we make mistake in our html page, but DOM overcomes those mistakes and loads the page.
          DOM can be described as interface between the web page and HTML page.
